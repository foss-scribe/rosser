# Chris Rosser's website

An [author's website](https://chrisrosser.net), built in Nuxt, and stored in a public repo just in case anyone finds it useful to pick through my source code.

All content is Copyright Chris Gardiner-Bill, writing as Chris Rosser.

Features:

* Reading list built from a single JSON file
* Analytics (Umami)
* UI built with Vue, TailwindCSS and DaisyUI
* Deploys to Netlify

Very much a work in progress
