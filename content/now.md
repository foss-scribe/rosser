## Writing and world-building

After a long hiatus in which I was preoccupied with work, family commitments and taekwondo, I'm slowly getting back into writing.

I've decided to start with some creative world-building, fleshing out my setting for the [_The Codex of Destiny_](/books/codex-of-destiny), which I'll [publish here](/worlds/alashiya).

Once I've made some inroads and found me feet with the setting and characters I'll return to writing the _The Codex of Destiny_.

## Development

I'm working on a website for my local taekwondo club.

The [rebuild and redesign](/blog/2024-11-05-redesign) of my website in Nuxt and TailwindCSS is mostly complete, though I'll continue to tweak the design and components as I publish more posts and world-building content. 

## Reading

Reading took a back seat for years while I was writing, but I'm trying [hard to read more again](/reading).
