## Preamble

In this document, I describe how and why I collect, store and use personal data for the daily operation of ChrisRosser.net. In an ideal world, I wouldn't collect a single shred of data. However, running a website with a membership and newsletter component requires that I collect and use personal information.

Privacy is important to me. Yes, that's easy to say and harder to prove, but I hope this document alleviates any concerns you might have.

## Guiding principles

I adhere to the following principles:

* Your data is yours, not mine, nor does it belong to big tech and media companies.
* I collect and use only the information I need to run my website.
* I put privacy before profit.
* I never sell personal information.
* When I delete data, it's gone for good.
* I take security seriously.

## Your rights

I believe privacy is a universal human right regardless of where you live and what jurisdiction governs your life.

* You have the right to know what information I collect and how I use it.
* You have the right to ask for and receive a copy of the information I hold.
* You have the right to withdraw consent to use your information.
* You have the right to have your information deleted upon your request.
* You have the right to be forgotten.

## Why I collect data

* Send newsletters and updates to members.
* Analyse aggregated visitor data.
* Protect my website and server from malicious actors.

## When I delete data

* When a member asks me to.
* When a member unsubscribes from my newsletter.

## Binding legislation

As a resident of Australia, I am bound to act under [Commonwealth](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/the-privacy-act) and [Victorian Government](https://www.legislation.vic.gov.au/in-force/acts/privacy-and-data-protection-act-2014/027) privacy legislation.

As my site allows access to and collects data from citizens of the United Kingdom and the European Union, I am also bound by the requirements of the [GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/).

## Children's Privacy

My website is not intended to be viewed by anyone under the age of 18. I do not knowingly or intentionally collect data from children, and should I learn if this has happened, I will immediately remove their data from my services and terminate their account.

## What I collect

I use analytics software, [Umami](https://umami.is) to collect visitor usage, device and location data. Data is stored on Umami's cloud services and automatically deleted after 6 months. Neither Umami nor I collect personal information.

Umami's privacy policy can be [read here](https://umami.is/privacy).

## Cookies

A cookie is a small piece of data stored on your device by the websites you visit.

While I limit the presence of third-party cookies, my hosting provider and CDN of choice, Cloudflare injects [some cookies](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/reference/policies-compliances/cloudflare-cookies/) into your browser. Additionally, some of my pages and blog posts may contain them as a result of embedding widgets such as Twitter posts and Amazon Kindle reading previews.


## Changes

I reserve the right to update this privacy policy at any time. Changes are tracked in my [site's GitHub repository](https://github.com/foss-scribe/rosser/blob/master/content/privacy.md).
