        text: Mistress of Skeinhold is a wonderful introduction to an exciting new Aussie voice in speculative fiction. I am very eager to read the next book and to discover more of this world that Rosser has created - and to follow Owain on his next adventure.

        text: Rosser's voice rings through like a clear dinner bell. Unobtrusive but undeniably present. The Weaver's Boy was a joy to read, and I'm looking forward to the next installment in the series.

        text: Full of bards, magic, and evil protagonists, this short work introduces readers to the woven world. The Lords of Skeinhold is the series name, and based on this work, looks to be one that will excite and entertain with all the elements that dark fantasy fans love.

Owain had waited a year to sing for the Duke of Kas Mendoc. But his master, the renowned Trystan of Langorn, has a change of heart, denying him the fame and honour he craves. They journey to Skeinhold Castle in the wild Cae Valley. Bitter and riddled with doubt, Owain wonders if he'll ever emerge from his master's long shadow.

Yet Skeinhold hides a dark secret known only to a dying lord and his runaway kin. The veil between worlds grows thin, and Owain's Dreamsight stirs. Who is the Lady of Skeinhold, and why does she possess an artefact thought lost? Can Owain and Trystan discover the truth in time, or will Owain succumb to temptation?

Mistress of Skeinhold is a prelude to The Weaver Cycle, a dark and sensual fantasy series set in a vibrant world.
