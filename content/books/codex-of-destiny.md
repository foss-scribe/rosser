    title: Chris Rosser | The Codex of Destiny
---

An exiled monk, his uncouth guide, and a slave bound by a demonic pact stumble across an ancient artefact of power in a ruined mountain city. Together they must cross the dangerous land of Tammassos to seek answers from the Great Sage. However, they are not the only ones searching for the legendary Codex of Destiny.

Set in the world of Alashiya, The Codex of Destiny began life as a serialised novel written exclusively for the members of Chris Rosser's Scriptorium.
