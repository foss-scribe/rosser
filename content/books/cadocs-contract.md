        text: "Cadoc's Contract is an enticing read that further cements Rosser - for me - as one of the new breed of rising stars on the Aussie Spec-fic scene. With a sure and confident hand Rosser weaves his tale with the same skills as the mystical 'weavers' in his world, enthralling the reader with strong and heartfelt characters, engaging dialogue and heart pounding fight scenes."

        text: Ulysses in Brief...Rosser is a consummate wordsmith. His metaphors and similes are perfection, and his ability to draw us into the moment with the hardened-soldier voice of his narrative evokes all the right emotions.

        text: Strongly developed characters in a small package help advance this story. This prequel to The Weaver's Boy sets the stage of what looks to be an epic dark fantasy series.

Cadoc wanted more than the life of a simple farmer. So, when Artur, Duke of Kas Mendoc raised his banner, Cadoc answered the call, marching south to enlist in a great crusade against the Oskoi. He travels to a distant land and carves his name into the bodies of the dead.

Yet Cadoc has a secret, a contract made with the gods to give him the strength he needs to survive this bloody war. One hundred souls â€“ a debt of blood to a hungry god. But disaster strikes, and Cadoc flees for his life. Can he face the men he left behind and account for those he killed? Has he paid his debt, or was his soul part of the price?

Cadoc's Contract is the prelude to The Weaver Cycle, a dark and sensual fantasy series set in a vibrant world.
