# Under construction

After shutting down my members area, I've decided to rebuild my site in [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com) to make it easier for me to maintain and improve upon.

You can still find my [reading list](/reading), landing pages for my books, or you can find my writing on [Medium](https://medium.com/@chrisrosser) and [Substack](https://chrisrosser.substack.com/).

Over the coming days (hopefully not weeks), I'll rebuild this home page and more...

Todo:

- [x] Add [_Cadoc's Contract_ book page](/books/cadocs-contract)
- [x] Add [_Mistress of Skeinhold_ book page](/books/mistress-of-skeinhold)
- [x] Add [reading list](/reading)
- [ ] Add _The Codex of Destiny_ book page
- [ ] Update privacy policy
- [ ] Create the home page (in progress)

    - [x] Hero
    - [x] Book list component
    - [x] Book progress widget
    - [x] Reading progress widget

- [ ] Add a static blog
- [ ] Add an about page


Best,
Chris R
