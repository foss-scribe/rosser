## Hey there, I'm Chris 

I am a writer (creative and technical) and full-stack web developer. I've maintained this website through various incarnations since 2007, sharing my stories, reviews, and thoughts. I live in Melbourne with my wife, three kids, and two cats.

Feel free to browse my site. You'll find my [books](/books), [reading list](/reading), what I'm doing [now](/now), and what I [use](/uses). I used to maintain a large blog here, but after much soul-searching, I've moved that to [Medium](https://medium.com/@chrisrosser), and my newsletter to [Substack](https://chrisrosser.substack.com/).

Nominally, I'm a fantasy author (or at least, I'm trying to be), and I've published two novellas with more to come (I hope). I've also dabbled in sci-fi, contemporary thrillers, and historical fiction. I blog about writing, technology, and productivity.
