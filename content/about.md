I wrote my first fantasy story when I was seven or eight years old—nearly forty years ago. The details are hazy, but the impulse is not. It was inspired by the first computer game I ever played, and it set a direction that has shaped my creative, personal, and professional life ever since. Whether writing was something innate or something learned is difficult to say; what matters is that it has remained a constant.

I published my [first fantasy novella](/books/mistress-of-skeinhold) in 2018, followed by a [second](/books/cadocs-contract) eighteen months later. That early momentum collided with the realities of family life, prolonged COVID lockdowns, and professional demands. In 2021, I returned to long-form fiction by serialising a novel titled _The Codex of Destiny_. Although that project stalled, it remains close to my heart, and I intend to return to it with renewed focus.

Alongside fiction, I have spent over twenty years as a technical writer and nearly as long as a full-stack web developer. My professional work has centred on APIs, docs-as-code, and the kind of highly structured systems that might seem at odds with fantasy storytelling—but which, in practice, sharpen precision, world-building, and clarity. I previously worked at Canva, before automation reshaped that role.

Academically, I hold a bachelor’s degree with honours in archaeology and history, and a master’s degree in editing and communication. My interests include philosophy, classical studies, history, language, and technology—disciplines that strongly influence my fiction.

Outside writing, I am a martial artist, with training across Taekwondo, Boxing, Karate (Gōjū-ryū and Shōtōkan), and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. Discipline, physical practice, and long-term study are as important to me as imagination.

Originally from Wales, I emigrated to Australia as a child. I now live in Melbourne with my wife, three children, and two cats.
