I was 7 or 8 when I wrote my first fantasy story — that was nearly 40 years ago, so I’m a bit vague on the when or what. I do remember, though, it was inspired by the first computer game I played. Whether writing was something I was born to do or grew to love is something I can’t answer, but it’s been the basis of my personal, creative and professional life to this day.

I published my [first fantasy novella](/books/mistress-of-skeinhold) in 2018 and my [second](/books/cadocs-contract) about 18 months later. Following that initial success, I hit the wall of mounting family commitments, months of COVID lockdowns, and career pressures. I managed to reverse that somewhat in 2021 when I began serialising a novel dubbed _The Codex of Destiny_. That stalled for some of the above reasons, but I look forward to relighting that fire.

I’ve been a technical writer for twenty years, and a full-stack web developer for nearly fifteen years. I specialise in docs as code, APIs and lots of nerd stuff that seems incongruous for a fantasy novelist. I currently work for Canva.

Long ago, I earned my bachelor’s degree with honours in archaeology and history and then a master’s in editing communication. I have a keen interest in philosophy, the classics, history language, and technology.

I’m an avid martial artist, and currently practice taekwondo and boxing.

I live in Melbourne, Australia, with my wife and three children.
