I was 7 or 8 when I wrote my first fantasy story — that was nearly 40 years ago, so I'm a bit vague on the when or what. I do remember, though, it was inspired by the [first computer game I played](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transylvania_(video_game)). Whether writing was something I was born to do or grew to love is something I can't answer, but it's been the foundation of my personal, creative and professional life to this day.

I published my [first fantasy novella](/books/mistress-of-skeinhold) in 2018 and my [second](/books/cadocs-contract) about 18 months later. Following that initial success, I hit the wall of mounting family commitments, months of COVID lockdowns, and career pressures. I managed to reverse that somewhat in 2021 when I began serialising a novel dubbed _The Codex of Destiny_. That stalled for some of the above reasons, but I look forward to relighting that fire.

I've been a technical writer for twenty years, and a full-stack web developer for nearly as long. I specialise in docs as code, APIs and lots of nerd stuff that seems incongruous for a fantasy novelist. I used to work for Canva, but they made me redunant, thanks to AI.

Long ago, I earned my bachelor's degree with honours in archaeology and history and then a master's degree in editing and communication. I have a lifelong interest in philosophy, the classics, history, language, and technology.

I'm an avid, practising martial artist with belts in Taekwondo, Boxing, Karate (Gōjū-ryū and Shōtōkan), and Brazilian Jui Jitsu.

Originally from Wales, I emigrated to Australia as a child. Today, I live in Melbourne, Australia, with my wife, three children and two cats.

You can find me on [Substack](https://chrisrosser.substack.com) and [Medium](https://chrisrosser.medium.com), but I don't use social media.
